# Country_Data_Clustering
The goal of this project was to find out the top 10 countries in dire need of aid and accordingly find a solution ratio to get the final distribution of funds in accordance with the country's situation.


What needs to be done is categorise the countries using some socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country and then suggest the countries that need the maximum funds.
